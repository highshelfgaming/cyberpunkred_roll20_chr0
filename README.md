This sheet was initially based on the boilerplate system by https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/foundryvtt-system-tutorial@asacolips#1897
The original html, css, js, and json files turning this into a Cyberpunk Red Jumpstart Kit Character sheet were all created by @gerdofal#0763 (discord) at https://github.com/Gerdofal/foundryvtt-cyberpunkred

The original sheet by Gerdofal was edited by High Shelf Gaming as a preliminary character sheet for use at launch of Cyberpunk Red. 
High Shelf Gaming will not continue maintenance of this character sheet.
 * another sheet is currently in development which does not use any of the above source materials.
